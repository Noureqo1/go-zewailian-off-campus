# ADR 002: WebSocket for Real-time Communication

## Status
Accepted

## 🧠Context
The platform requires real-time chat functionality with minimal latency and efficient server resource usage.

## ✅Decision
We will use WebSocket protocol for real-time communication, implemented using Go's Gorilla WebSocket library.

## 🎯Consequences
### Positive
- Full-duplex communication
- Lower latency compared to HTTP polling
- Reduced server load
- Native support in modern browsers

### Negative
- Need for connection management
- Potential challenges with load balancers
- Must handle connection drops gracefully
- Additional complexity in client implementation
