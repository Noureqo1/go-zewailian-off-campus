# ADR 001: Adoption of Microservices Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## ðŸ§ Context
The Zewailian Off Campus platform needs to handle multiple distinct functionalities (chat, blogging, resource sharing) with different scaling requirements and development velocities.

## âœ…Decision
We will implement a microservices architecture using Go for the backend services.

## ðŸŽ¯Consequences
### Positive
- Independent scaling of services
- Technology flexibility per service
- Isolated failure domains
- Easier maintenance and updates
- Better team organization around services

### Negative
- Increased operational complexity
- Need for service orchestration
- Network latency between services
- More complex testing scenarios
